# Bootstrap Example Rails Lab

## Objectives

1. Integrate Bootstrap into a Rails App via the Bootstrap Gem


## Outline

Make sure they include the gem.

Make sure the manifests require bootstrap correctly.

Make sure the layout uses bootstrap.

Expect certain common bootstrap dom like a 3x3 grid or columns or a static header, I'd suggest basically having them build 1 or 2 of the bootstrap examples in static views like http://getbootstrap.com/examples/jumbotron/ or http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/ or anything on http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples
